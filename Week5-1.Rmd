# Some built-in functions for numbers
<hr>

Almost everthing in R is done through functions. <br>

Here are some commonly used functions that work with numbers.

## Numeric functions

::::{.card data-latex=""}
<br>
__abs(x)__   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; absolute value

__sqrt(x)__  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  square root -- x^(1/2), x**(1/2)

__round(x, digits = n)__  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   round x to n decimal digits

__log(x)__    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;               natural logarithm (base e)

__log10(x)__   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;              common logarith (base 10)

__exp(x)__     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;              expoentials e^x

## Statistical functions

::::{.card data-latex=""}
<br>
__mean(x, na.rm = FALSE)__  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mean of x

__median(x)__    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;            median of x

__sd(x)__     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;               standard deviation of x

__quantile(x, probs)__  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     quantiles of x with probability

__range(x)__    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;             smallest to largest values

__max(x)__      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;             maximum

__min(x)__      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;             minimum

__sum(x)__      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;             summation

# Write functions
<hr>

One of the great strengths of R is user can write customized functions. 

In general, if you find yourself doing a lot of cutting and pasting, thatâ€™s usually a good sign to write a function.

Functions are defined using the function() and are stored as R objects just like anything else. 

```{r, eval=F}
# Basic structure of creating a function 
function_name <- function(arguments) {
         function body
 }

# A simple example: convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
f_to_c <- function(temp_F) {
  temp_C <- (temp_F - 32) * 5 / 9
  #return(temp_C),
}

# In R, the return value of a function is always the very last expression that is evaluated
print(f_to_c(32))

airquality %>% 
  mutate(temp_c = f_to_c(Temp))
```


## Argument matching

R functions arguments can be matched by position or by name.<br> 

Position matching just means that R assigns the first value to the first argument, the second value to second argument. 

```{r, eval = F}
obtain_math = function(a, b){
  a*a + b
}

print(f(a = 1, b = 2)) # arguments matched by name

print(f(1, 2)) # arguments matched by position

print(f(2, 1))

```

## Argument with a default value

We must provide the argument values in the obtain_match() function if defualt values are not available

```{r, eval = F}
obtain_math(a = 1) # what happen if the value of b is missing?

```

We can modify the function to avoid such error by providing default values for arguments
```{r, eval = F}
obtain_math_v1 <- function(a, b=2){
  a*a + b
}

obtain_math_v1(1)
```

## Apply functions

You can create and use functions inside your script. 

```{r, eval = F}
#create a function to convert a month to season
obtain_season <- function(month){
    case_when(month %in% c(12, 1, 2) ~ "winter",
              month %in% c(3, 4, 5) ~ "spring",
              month %in% c(6, 7, 8) ~ "summer",
              month %in% c(9, 10, 11) ~ "fall")
}

obtain_season(7)

#apply the obtain_season() function 
library(tidyverse)

airquality %>% 
  mutate(season = obtain_season(Month))

```

You can also save your functions in a different script and use them again and again. 

```{r, eval=F}
# we created a ObtainSeason() function and saved it in the my_functions.R
source('./script/my_functions.R') #use source() to read R code
class(ObtainSeason)

airquality %>% 
  mutate(season = ObtainSeason(Month))

```

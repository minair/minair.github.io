We aren't computer scientists and that's okay! 

We make lots of mistakes. Mistakes are funny. You can laugh with us.

Let's go, Simba, Pumbaa, and Timon!

# list - another data structure
<hr>

List is a special type of vector. It is not limited to single data type. A list can contain any mixture of data types even mixtures of data structures. 

<center>
![](image/list.png){width=200px}

</center>

We use the list() to create a list.

```{r, eval=F}

x <- list(1, "a", TRUE) 

class(x)

x[2] # subset a list, return a list

x[[2]] # return the simpliest possible data structure

x1 <- list(1:4, 0.6, c('a', 'b'))

# how to extract element 'a' in the list x1 

```

We can also create an empty list with predefined length with the vector() function 

```{r, eval=F}
y <- vector("list", length = 5)

length(y)

```

Vectors can be converted to lists using the as.list() function

```{r, eval=F}
z <- c(1, 2, 3)

class(z)

z <- as.list(z)

class(z)
```

# apply family of functions
<hr>

R has some functions which implement looping in a compact form to make your code easier to write and to read. 

__lappy()__: takes a vector or list and applys a function on each item element. 



sapply(): Same as lapply but try to simplify the result



apply(): takes a data frame and applys a function on each row or each column of the input. 

<br>

## lapply() 

This function does the following series of operations:

1. it loops over a list, iterating over each element

2. it applies a function to each element of the list

3. returns a __list__

```{r, eval=F}
# the basic usage of lappy() function

lapply(X, FUN, ...)

X: a vector or a list(

FUN: the function to be applied

...: optional arguments to FUN
)

# calculate the mean value of each element of list x

x <- list(a = 1:5, b = rnorm(10), c = c(1, 3, NA, 7))

print(x)

y <- lapply(x, mean)

class(y)

```

Here we are passing mean() as an argument to lapply(). When we pass a function to another function, we do not need to include () like we call a function. 


Any arguments in the ... argument will get passed down to the function that applied to the list. 

```{r, eval=F}

lapply(x, mean, na.rm = T)

```

Sometime, you will see lappy() and its friends use anonymous functions. 
These are functions are generated inside lapply(). Once the call to lapply() is finished, the function disappears. 

```{r, eval=F}

# extract the 2nd value of each elements

test <- list(x = runif(5), y = rnorm(5), z = c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' ))

test[[1]][2]
test[[2]][2]
test[[3]][2]

lapply(test, function(x){x[2]})

# using the anonymous function has the same result as the following script: 

f <- function(x){
  x[2]
}

lapply(test, f)


```

If the function is going to be used a lot in other parts of your code, you might want to define it separately. But if it's going to be used just for this call to lapply(), then itâ€™s probably simpler to use an anonymous function.

::::{.quiz data-latex="Exercise "}

__Exercise __

Use lapply() to seperate and save airquality data by month.

::::

## sapply() 

The sapply() function behaves similarly to lapply(); the only real difference is in the return value. 

```{r, eval=F}
test <- list(a = 1:4, b = rnorm(10), c = rnorm(20, 1), d = rnorm(100, 5))

lapply(test, mean)

sapply(test, mean)
```

<br>

## apply()

This function takes a matrix or data frame and performs a function on each row or each column of the input individually (1 for rows, 2 for columns).

```{r, eval=F}
a <- data.frame(c1 = 1:3, c2 = 4:6, c3 = c(7, 8, NA))

a

# row products
apply(a, 1, function(x){prod(x, na.rm = T)})

# column products
apply(a, 2, function(x){prod(x, na.rm = T)})


```

Usually there are better alternatives for column-wise operations on data frames.
